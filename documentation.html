<h3 id="build">Build</h3>

<p>Libmill runs in following environments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microarchitecture: x86_64, ARM</li>
  <li>Compiler: gcc, clang</li>
  <li>Operating system: Linux, OSX, FreeBSD</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether it works in different environments is not known - please, do report
any successes or failures on the project mailing list.</p>

<t>Download the package from the download page. Then build and install
as follows:</p>

<pre>
$ tar -xzf libmill-0.16-beta.tar.gz
$ cd libmill-0.16-beta
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
</pre>

<p>After the installation there's <tt>libmill.h</tt> header file available
as well as dynamic library <tt>libmill.so</tt> and static library
<tt>libmill.a</tt>.</p>

<p>A program using the library can look like this:</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "libmill.h"

void worker(int count, const char *text) {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i != count; ++i) {
        printf("%s\n", text);
        msleep(10);
    }
}

int main() {
    go(worker(4, "a"));
    go(worker(2, "b"));
    go(worker(3, "c"));
    msleep(100);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>To build the example:</p>

<pre>
gcc -o example example.c -lmill
</pre>

<h3 id="coroutines">Coroutines</h3>

<p>Any function can be executed as a coroutine using <tt>go</tt> keyword:</p>

<pre>
void foo(int i, int j) {
    ...
}

int main() {
    go(foo(1, 2));
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>However, keep in mind that coroutines are executed asynchronously and thus,
even if the function returns a value, there is now way to retrieve it.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that coroutines are scheduled in a cooperative fashion.
If one coroutine blocks, for example by calling <tt>sleep()</tt>, it blocks
the entire process. Therefore, coroutine-friendly versions of blocking functions
(such as <tt>msleep()</tt> or <tt>fdwait()</tt>, see below) should be used.</p>

<p>In case of need, you can yield CPU to other coroutines explicitly:</p>

<pre>
yield();
</pre>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>Channels are typed pipes used for communication between coroutines. To create
a channel you have to specify what kind of values are meant to be passed
through it. The second parameter is buffer size. Setting this argument
to zero creates an unbuffered channel:</p>

<pre>
chan ch = chmake(int, 0);
</pre>

<p>To send a value to the channel use <tt>chs()</tt> function. The type
specified as the second parameter must match the type of the channel otherwise
you'll get runtime exception:</p>

<pre>
chs(ch, int, 42);
</pre>

<p>To receive a value from the channel use <tt>chr()</tt> function. The type
specified as the second parameter must match the type of the channel otherwise
the program will abort with runtime exception:</p>

<pre>
int i = chr(ch, int);
</pre>

<p>When sender is done with sending it can announce the fact using
<tt>chdone()</tt> function. It will cause all the receivers on the channel to
receive the value specified in the third parameter indefinitely:</p>

<pre>
chdone(ch, int, -1);
</pre>

<p>To deallocate the channel use <tt>chclose()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
chclose(ch);
</pre>

<p>Note that <tt>chclose()</tt> deallocates any elements remaining the channel,
however, if the element itself has a pointer to a different object, that object
won't be deallocated. In this respect <tt>chclose()</tt> is similar to the
standard <tt>free()</tt> function.</p>

<p>When sharing a channel between two or more coroutines you can duplicate
the channel handle. Channel is deallocated only after all its handles
are closed. For example:</p>

<pre>
void sender(chan ch) {
    chs(ch, int, 42);
    chclose(ch);
}

int main() {
    chan ch = chmake(int, 0);
    go(sender(chdup(ch)));
    int i = chr(ch, int);
    assert(i == 42);
    chclose(ch);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3 id="choose">Choose statement</h3>

<p>Choose statement is equivalent to Go's <tt>select</tt> statement. It can be
used to wait for multiple channels.</p>

<p>Within <tt>choose</tt> there's a list of clauses. Each clause is either an
<tt>in</tt> clause (waiting for incoming messages) or an <tt>out</tt> clause
(waiting till a message can be sent to the channel). Last cause can optionally
be an <tt>otherwise</tt> clause. Don't forget to add <tt>end</tt> keyword before
the closing parenthesis:</p>

<pre>
choose {
in(ch1, int, val):
    printf("Value %d received from ch1.\n", val);
out(ch2, int, 42):
    printf("Value 42 sent to ch2.\n");
otherwise:
    printf("Neither ch1 nor ch2 can be used at the moment.\n");
end
}
</pre>

<p>Clause <tt>in</tt> causes <tt>choose</tt> to wait for a message coming
from channel <tt>ch</tt>. The clause declares variable <tt>var</tt> of type
<tt>type</tt> and stores the incoming message into it. If <tt>type</tt> doesn't
match the actual type of the channel you'll get a runtime exception:</p>

<pre>
in(ch, type, var):
</pre>

<p>Clause <tt>out</tt> causes <tt>choose</tt> to wait while value <tt>val</tt>
of type <tt>type</tt> can be sent to channel <tt>ch</tt>. Same way as with
</tt>in</tt>, if <tt>type</tt> doesn't match the actual type of channel
<tt>ch</tt> runtime exception is generated:</p>

<pre>
out(ch, type, val):
</pre>

<p>Clause <tt>otherwise</tt> is optional. It is executed only if no other
clauses can be matched immediately. Therefore, <tt>choose</tt> statement
with <tt>otherwise</tt> clause will never block.</p>

<p><tt>choose</tt> statement waits for the first clause that can be executed,
executes it and then jumps to the code following the clause. If there are
multiple clauses that can be executed one of them is chosen at random.</p>

<p>There's no fall-through among the clauses.</p>

<h3 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h3>

<p>Unlike standard POSIX functions, libmill uses dealines rather than
timeouts.</p>

<p>Deadline is a point in time when a function should finish. Function
<tt>now()</tt> returns the current point in time. You can add milliseconds to
it to get a point in time in the future. Following example defines a deadline
that expires one second from now:</p>

<pre>
int64_t deadline = now() + 1000;
</pre>

<p>The advantage of deadlines over timeouts is that a single deadline can be
reused in many subsequent function calls without having to worry about
readjusting its value to account for time already elapsed since the deadline
was created.</p>

<p>Value of -1 is used to specify that there is no deadline or, if you will,
that the deadline is infinite.</p>

<h3 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h3>

<p>It was already mentioned that a single call to <tt>sleep()</tt> can block
the entire process. To avoid the problem use <tt>msleep()</tt> instead.
Note that the argument is a deadline, not a timeout:</p>

<pre>
msleep(now() + 1000);
</pre>

<h3 id="fds">Waiting for file descriptors</h3>

<p>To wait for an event from a file descriptor use <tt>fdwait</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
int events = fdwait(fd, FDW_IN | FDW_OUT, -1);
if(events & FDW_IN) {
    ...
}
if(events & FDW_OUT) {
    ...
}
if(events & FDW_ERR) {
    ...
}
</pre>

<p><tt>FDW_IN</tt> waits until there's at least one byte available to be
read from the file descriptor.</p>

<p><tt>FDW_OUT</tt> waits until at least one byte can be written to the file
descriptor.</p>

<p><tt>FDW_ERR</tt> cannot be used as an argument to <tt>fdwait()</tt>, but it
can be returned from the function irrespective of whether you want it or
not.</p>

<p>If an error happens while there are still bytes to be received from the
socket combination of <tt>FDW_ERR</tt> and <tt>FDW_IN</tt> may be returned.

<p>The third parameter to <tt>fdwait()</tt> is a deadline. If deadline is hit
the function returns zero.</p>

<h3 id="ip">Resolving IP addresses</h3>

<p>Network functionality, such as TCP or UDP, can be accessed via standard POSIX
functions provided that you do it in a non-blocking way. To save you the trouble
though, libmill provides a simple convenience wrapper on top of it.</p>

<p>To use TCP or UDP you need IP addresses first. The wrapper type for IP
addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) is called <tt>ipaddr</tt>. It also
includes port number. Unlike address types in POSIX it can be used as a basic
type. It can be assigned, returned from a function and so on.</p>

<p>There are two functions to construct IP addresses: <tt>iplocal()</tt> that
retrieves the IP address of a local network interface and <tt>ipremote()</tt>
that gets IP address of a remote machine. In addition to that, certain other
library functions, <tt>udprecv()</tt>, for one, return IP addresses.</p>

<p><tt>iplocal()</tt> converts a textual form of IP address, or a name of a
local network interface and a port number into <tt>ipaddr</tt>:</p>

<pre>
ipaddr addr1 = iplocal("127.0.0.1", 3333, 0);
ipaddr addr2 = iplocal("::1", 4444, 0);
ipaddr addr3 = iplocal("eth0", 5555, 0);
</pre>

<p>The last (<tt>mode</tt>) argument specifies which kind of addresses you are
interested in. Possible values are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IPADDR_IPV4: get IPv4 address or error if it's not available</li>
  <li>IPADDR_IPV6: get IPv6 address or error if it's not available</li>
  <li>IPADDR_PREF_IPV4: get IPv4 address if possible, IPv6 address otherwise;
      error if none is available</li>
  <li>IPADDR_PREF_IPV6: get IPv6 address if possible, IPv4 address otherwise;
      error if none is available</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting the argument to zero means "default" behaviour, which, at the
present, is IPADDR_PREF_IPV4. However, in the future when IPv6 becomes more
common it may be switched to IPADDR_PREF_IPV6.</p>

<p>If address parameter is set to NULL, INADDR_ANY or in6addr_any is returned.
This value is useful when binding to all local network interfaces.</p>

<p>In case of error <tt>errno</tt> is set to appropriate error code. Returned
address has family type AF_UNSPEC which will cause any function you pass it to
to fail.</tt>

<p>The second function to produce IP addresses is <tt>ipremote()</tt>. It
converts textual form of IP address to <tt>ipaddr</tt>. In the future it is
also meant to resolve remote host names, but this functionality is not
available yet. The function also requires port, mode (same as in
<tt>iplocal()</tt>) and a deadline:</p>

<pre>
ipaddr addr = ipremote("192.168.0.111", 5555, 0, -1);
</pre>

<p>Behaviour in case of error is same as with <tt>iplocal()</tt>.

<h3 id="tcp">TCP library</h3>

<h4>Connecting to a remote endpoint</h4>

<p>To connect to a remote server, use <tt>tcpconnect()</tt> function:

<pre>
ipaddr addr = ipremote("192.168.0.111", 5555, 0, -1);
tcpsock s = tcpconnect(addr, -1);
</pre>

<p>The arguments are IP address, port number and a deadline.</p>

<p>In case of error the function returns NULL and sets <tt>errno</tt> to one
of the standard POSIX error values. If the deadline is reached, <tt>errno</tt>
is set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>.</p>

<h4>Listening for incoming connections</h4>

<p>To start listening for incoming TCP connections use <tt>tcplisten()</tt>
function. To accept a new connection use <tt>tcpaccept()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
ipaddr addr = iplocal("eth0", 5555, 0);
tcpsock ls = tcplisten(addr, 10);
while(1) {
    tcpsock s = tcpaccept(ls, -1);
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>The second argument is unaccepted connection backlog, same as in POSIX
<tt>listen()</tt> function.</p>

<p>First argument is an IP address of the local network interface
to bind to. If port number is zero an ephemeral port number will be chosen by
the operating system. In such case you can retrieve the port number using
<tt>tcppport()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
ipaddr addr = iplocal(NULL, 5555, 0);
tcpsock ls = tcplisten(addr, 10);
int port = tcpport(ls);
</pre>

<p>In case of error <tt>tcplisten()</tt> function returns NULL and sets
<tt>errno</tt> to one of the standard POSIX error values.</p>

<p><tt>tcpaccept()</tt> function takes the listening socket and a deadline
as arguments and returns the newly accepted socket:</p>

<pre>
tcpsock s = tcpaccept(ls, now() + 1000);
</pre>

<p>In case of error it returns NULL and sets <tt>errno</tt> to one of the
standard POSIX error values. If the deadline is reached, <tt>errno</tt>
is set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>.</p>

<h4>Sending data</h4>

<p>To send data to the connection use <tt>tcpsend()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
size_t nbytes = tcpsend(s, "ABC", 3, -1);
</pre>

<p>The arguments are the socket to send the data to, the buffer to send,
number of bytes to send and a deadline. Number of bytes actually sent
is returned.</p>

<p>In the case of success, <tt>errno</tt> is set to zero. If the connection
is broken it is set to <tt>ECONNRESET</tt>. If the deadline expires it is
set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>.</p>

<p>To optimise the throughput <tt>tcpwrite()</tt> may store the data into output
buffer and not flush it into the network immediately. To force actual sending
of the data use <tt>tcpflush</tt> function.</p>

<pre>
tcpflush(s, -1);
</pre>

<p>Arguments are the socket to flush and a deadline.</p>

<p>In the case of success, <tt>errno</tt> is set to zero. If the connection
is broken it is set to <tt>ECONNRESET</tt>. If the deadline expires it is
set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>.</p>

<h4>Receiving data</h4>

<p>To read data from a connection use <tt>tcprecv()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
size_t nbytes = tcprecv(s, buf, 256, -1);
</pre>

<p>The arguments are the socket to receive from, the buffer to receive to,
size of the buffer and a deadline. Number of bytes actually received is
returned.</p>

<p>In the case of success, <tt>errno</tt> is set to zero. If the connection
breaks it is set to <tt>ECONNRESET</tt>. If the deadline expires it is
set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>.</p>

<p>To help with dealing with text-based protocols libmill provides
<tt>tcprecvuntil()</tt> function. It acts the same as <tt>tcpread()</tt> except
that the reading stops when one of specified characters is encountered:</p>

<pre>
size_t nbytes = tcprecvuntil(conn, buf, 256, "\n" , 1, -1);
</pre>

<p>The arguments are the socket to receive from, the buffer to receive to,
size of the buffer, the delimiter characters, how many of them are there
and a deadline. Number of bytes actually received, including the delimiter
character, is returned.</p>

<p>In the case of success, <tt>errno</tt> is set to zero. If the connection
breaks it is set to <tt>ECONNRESET</tt>. If the deadline expires it is
set to <tt>ETIMEDOUT</tt>. If the entire buffer was filled without encountering
the delimiter character, <tt>errno</tt> is set to <tt>ENOBUFS</tt>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that mutliple delimiter characters means that receiving stops
if any of them is received rather than when the entire string of them
is received:</p>

<pre>
/* Read until comma or right brace is encountered. */
size_t nbytes = tcprecvuntil(conn, buf, 256, ",}" , 2, -1);
</pre>

<h4>Cleaning up</h4>

<p>To close sockets (both listening and connected ones) use <tt>tcpclose()</tt>
function:</p>

<pre>
tcpclose(s);
</pre>

<h3 id="udp">UDP library</h3>

<p>To open an UDP socket use <tt>udplisten()</tt> function. IP address of the
local network interface should be supplied.:</p>

<pre>
ipaddr addr = iplocal("192.168.0.111", 5555, 0);
udpsock s = udplisten(addr);
</pre>

<p>If port is set to zero operating system selects an unused port. The number
of the port can be retrieved using <tt>udpport()</tt> function:</tt>

<pre>
int port = udpport(s);
</pre>

<p>Once the socket is open it can be immediately used for both sending and
receiving.</p>

<p>Given that UDP transport is unconnected by its very nature the address of
remote endpoint has to be specified in every <tt>udpsend()</tt> call.
Similarly, the IP address of the remote endpoint is returned by each
<tt>udprecv()</tt> call.</p>

<p>To send a packet to the remote peer use <tt>udpsend()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
ipaddr addr = ipremote("192.168.0.111", 5555, 0, -1);
udpsend(s, addr, "Hello, world!", 13);
</pre>

<p>The function has no return value but in the case of failure it sets
<tt>errno</tt> to the appropriate value. If there is no error <tt>errno</tt>
is set to zero.</p>

<p>Note that <tt>udpsend()</tt> has no deadline. UDP transport is unreliable
and the packet is either delivered or lost, but never blocked.</p>

<p>To receive a packet from the socket use <tt>udprecv()</tt> function.
If successful the function will return the size of the received packet,
in bytes, and set <tt>ipaddr</tt> passed in the parameter to the source
address of the packet:</p>

<pre>
char buf[256];
ipaddr addr;
size_t sz = udprecv(s, &addr, buf, sizeof(buf), -1);
</pre>

<p>In the case of failure <tt>errno</tt>is set to the appropriate error.
In the case of success <tt>errno</tt> is set to zero.</p>

<p>When done close the UDP socket:</p>

<pre>
udpclose(s);
</pre>

<h3 id="unix">UNIX library</h3>

<p>Unix sockets are used for communicating between processes on the same
machine.</p>

<p>The API is identical to the TCP API with all <tt>tcp</tt> prefixes replaced
by <tt>unix</tt> prefixes, e.g. <tt>unixsock</tt> or <tt>unixrecv()</tt>.</p>

<p>Additionally, addresses passed to <tt>unixlisten()</tt> and
<tt>unixconnect()</tt> represent are names of a local files rather than
IP addresses. Also, there are no ports:</tt>

<pre>
unixsock s = unixconnect("/tmp/test.unix");
</pre>

Function <tt>unixpair()</tt> creates a pair of connected sockets. It's a wrapper
on top of standard <tt>socketpair()</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
unixsock s1, s2;
unixpair(&s1, &s2);
</pre>

<h3 id="cls">Coroutine-local storage</h3>

<p>Coroutine-local storage is an advanced mechanism meant to be used in
special cases. Avoid using it if possible. In general, use it where you would
use thread-local storage in a threaded program. TLS itself cannot be used with
libmill as multiple coroutines can share the same OS thread.</p>

<p>Coroutine local data are a single pointer which can be set like this:</p>

<pre>
void *data = ...;
setcls(data);
</pre>

<p>Later on the pointer can be accessed anywhere within the coroutine or any
function invoked from it using <tt>cls</tt> function:</p>

<pre>
void *data = cls();
</pre>

<p>It can be safely assumed that before coroutine-local data are set,
<tt>cls</tt> function will return <tt>NULL</tt>.</p>

<h3 id="memory">Dealing with memory</h3>

<p>Most libmill functions report out of memory condition in the common way.
<tt>chmake()</tt> returns <tt>NULL</tt>, <tt>tcplisten()</tt> returns
<tt>NULL</tt> and sets <tt>errno</tt> to <tt>ENOMEM</tt> and so on.</p>

<p>There's one exception though. Namely, if there's not enough memory to
allocate call stack for a new coroutine runtime panic happens and the process
is terminated.</p>

<p>If you wish to prevent that from happening you can allocate the coroutine
stacks in advance, typically when the process is starting, using
<tt>goprepare()</tt> function.</p>

<p>Specify the number of coroutine stacks to preallocate, their size
in bytes and, additionally, the size of the biggest element you are going to
pass through libmill channels:</p>

<pre>
int count = goprepare(100, 100000, 128);
</pre>

<p>The function returns number of stacks that it actually managed
to allocate.</p>

<p>From that point on your program shouldn't fail when launching a coroutine.
However, if you launch more parallelly running coroutines than allocated
or pass a bigger element than specified through a channel, memory allocations
will start happening again and all bets are off.</p>

<p>NOTE: On some systems (e.g. Linux) memory overcommit is switched on by
default. On such systems your application may be selected to be killed in low
memory conditions without you having any say in it. If you can't guarantee that
memory overcommit will be switched off when running the program don't even
bother with the measures described above.</p>

<h3 id="debug">Debugging</h3>

<p>Libmill provides a couple of functions to help with the debugging. They can
be invoked either directly from the program or manually from the debugger.</p>

<p>When inspecting debug output following rules apply:</>

<ol>
  <li>Both coroutines and channels are represented by decimal IDs.</li>
  <li>The IDs are never re-used, even if the original object was already
      deallocated.</li>
  <li>Coroutine IDs are printed in curly braces, e.g. <tt>{24}</tt>.</li>
  <li>Channel IDs are printed in pointy braces, e.g. <tt>&lt;24&gt;</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>goredump</h4>

<p>When debugging a program you may want to inspect the coroutines being
run and the channels being used. Use <tt>goredump</tt> function to do
exactly that.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how to use it directly from a <tt>gdb</tt>
   session:</p>

<pre>
Breakpoint 1, main () at foo.c:57
57	    if(quux &lt; 0) {
(gdb) p goredump()

$2 = void
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>The first section is coroutine dump. It contains the list of all coroutines,
each accompanied by its ID, state, the line of code that's it is executing at
the moment and to the line that originally created the coroutine.</p>

<p>The dump doesn't contain coroutine name. To map the coroutine record to
the actual coroutine in the code, check the line referenced by 'created'
field.</p>

<p>The 'state' field gives you more information about the operation being
performed. When a coroutine is blocked in <tt>chr</tt> call, for example,
you'll also see the ID of the channel it is trying to receive from:</p>

<pre>
COROUTINE  state                  current           created
----------------------------------------------------------------------
{8}        chr(&lt;8&gt;)               foo.c:63          foo.c:158
</pre>

<p>When <tt>choose</tt> statement is being executed a list of channel IDs
is provided, corresponding to the list of clauses in the <tt>choose</tt>
statement:</p>

<pre>
COROUTINE  state                  current           created
----------------------------------------------------------------------
{14}       choose(&lt;5&gt;,&lt;3&gt;)        foo.c:22          foo.c:107
</pre>

<p>If there are any channels created by the user coroutine dump will be followed
by a channel dump. Each record in the dump corresponds to one channel instance
and contains its ID, number of messages buffered in the channel, channel
capacity, its reference count, whether <tt>chdone()</tt> was already called
and a the line of code that created the channel.</p> 

<p>Additionally, if there are any coroutines waiting for messages from the
channel -- whether via <tt>chr</tt> or <tt>choose</tt> -- they are reported
like this:</p>

<pre>
CHANNEL  msgs/max    senders/receivers     refs  done  created
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;1&gt;      0/0         r:{4},{5}             2     no    foo.c:391
</pre>

<p>The waiting coroutines are served in the displayed order, i.e. when a new
message is sent to the channel it will be dispatched to coroutine 4. Next one
will go to coroutine 5 and so on.</p>

<p>Similarly, if there are coroutines trying to send message to the channel
but unable to do so becuase the channel's buffer if full they are reported in
the following way:</p>

<pre>
CHANNEL  msgs/max    senders/receivers     refs  done  created
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;1&gt;      100/100     r:{2},{13}            2     no    foo.c:392
</pre>

<p>If there are no coroutines waiting to send or receive messages from the
channel the field is kept empty.</p>

<h4>gotrace</h4>

<p>It is possible to switch on tracing via <tt>gotrace()</tt> function. You can
do so either programmatically or from the debugger:</p>

<pre>
gotrace(1);
</pre>

<p>The function takes a single argument, the desired tracing level.
At the moment there are only two supported tracing levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0: tracing is off; this is the default value.</li>
  <li>1: invocations of all libmill functions are traced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trace records are written to <tt>stderr</tt>. That way it is possible to
redirect the trace records to a file, while keeping the original output of the
program in the console:</p>

<pre>
$ ./test 2> trace.log
</pre>

<p>A part of the trace may look, for example, like this:</p>

<pre>
==> 22:24:56.404183 {0}      &lt;1&gt;=chmake(0) at tests/choose.c:113
==> 22:24:56.404276 {0}      {1}=go() at tests/choose.c:114
==> 22:24:56.404292 {1}      chdup(&lt;1&gt;) at tests/choose.c:114
==> 22:24:56.404304 {1}      chr(&lt;1&gt;) at tests/choose.c:30
==> 22:24:56.404316 {0}      choose() at tests/choose.c:115
==> 22:24:56.404354 {0}      chclose(&lt;1&gt;) at tests/choose.c:120
</pre>

<p>Each trace record contains timestamp, ID of the coroutine that have generated
the trace, the function being executed along with its arguments and the location
of its invocation in the source code.</p>

<p>The format is designed to be machine-friendly and, more specifically,
grep-friendly.</p>

<p>If you have a file that mixes trace records with other output, grep will
help you filter out the trace records:</p>

<pre>
$ grep "==>" trace.log
</pre>

<p>Similarly, you can filter out records related to a particular coroutine
or a specific channel:</p>

<pre>
$ grep "{9}" trace.log
$ grep "&lt;33&gt;" trace.log
</pre>
