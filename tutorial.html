<h2>Tutorial</h2>

<p>In this tutorial you will develop a simple TCP "greet" server. The client
is meant to connect to it via telnet. After doing so, the server will ask
for their name, reply with a greeting and close the connection.</p>

<p>An interaction with our server will look like this:</p>

<pre>
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 5555
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
What's your name?
Bartholomaeus
Hello, Bartholomaeus!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

<p>In the process you will learn how to use coroutines, channels and the TCP
library.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Setting up the stage</h3>

<p>First, include libmill's header file. Later on you will also need errno,
stdio and stdlib, so include those as well:</p> 

<pre>
#include &lt;libmill.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>Add the <tt>main</tt> function. We'll assume, that the first argument,
if present, will be port number to be used by the server. If not specified,
we will default to 5555:</p>

<pre>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int port = 5555;
    if(argc &gt; 1)
        port = atoi(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Now we can start doing the actual interesting stuff.</p>

<p>Libmill's <tt>tcplisten()</tt> function can be used to create listening
TCP socket. The socket will be used to accept new TCP connections from the
clients:</p>

<pre>
tcpsock ls = tcplisten(NULL, port);
if(!ls) {
    perror("Can't open listening socket");
    return 1;
}
</pre>

<p>First argument to the function can be used to specify local network interface
to bind to. This is an advanced functionality and you likely won't need it.
Conveniently, you can just ignore it and pass <tt>NULL</tt> to the function.
The server will then bind to all available local network interfaces.</p>

<p>The second argument is, unsurprisingly, the port that the clients will
connect to. When testing the program keep in mind that the range of valid port
numbers is 1 to 65535 and that ports from 1 to 1023 typically require superuser
privileges.</p>

<p>If <tt>tcplisten()</tt> fails it returns NULL and sets <tt>errno</tt> to
appropriate error code. Libmill's TCP functions are in this respect very similar
to standard POSIX APIs. What it means is that we can use standard POSIX
mechanims -- <tt>perror()</tt> in this case -- to deal with errors.</p>

<p>Finally, we can clean up by closing the socket:</p>

<pre>
tcpclose(ls);
</pre>

<p>The source code for this step can be found in <tt>tutotial/step1.c</tt>.
Source code for all the following steps will be also available in the same
directory.</p>

<p>Build the code like this:</p>

<pre>
$ gcc -o greetserver step1.c -lmill
</pre>

<p>Then run the resulting executable:</p>

<pre>
$ ./greetserver
$
</pre>

<p>As a well-behaved UNIX program, greetserver will succeed silently. To test
whether error hadling works as expected we can try to use invalid port
number:</p>

<pre>
$ ./greetserver 70000
Can't open listening socket: Invalid argument
$
</pre>

<p>Yay! Everyting seems to work as expected. Let's now move to the step 2.</p>

<h3>Step 2: The business logic</h3>
