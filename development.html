<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Source code</h3>

<p>Source code is hosted on GitHub:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sustrik/mill">https://github.com/sustrik/mill</a></p>

<p>Source code of this website is located in gh-pages branch:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sustrik/mill/tree/gh-pages">https://github.com/sustrik/mill/tree/gh-pages</a></p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>If developing mill (as opposed to just using it) build it the following way.</p>

<p>First, install these prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Ruby
<li>Install libuv from here: <a href="https://github.com/joyent/libuv">https://github.com/joyent/libuv</a>
<li>Install ribosome from here: <a href="https://github.com/sustrik/ribosome">https://github.com/sustrik/ribosome</a>
<li>Install Ragel from here: <a href="http://www.complang.org/ragel/">http://www.complang.org/ragel/</a>
</ul>

<p>Then execute the following sequence commands:</p>

<pre>
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-gen
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

<h3>Understanding the toolchain</h3>

<p>The files in the project are generated in the following way. Grey boxes represent target files (ones to be used by the end user):</p>

<img src="toolchain.png">

<p>'clexer.lr' is a file describing C tokens that is processed by Ragel to create C tokeniser. Use -R option when running Ragel to create Ruby version of the tokeniser. Note that there is no parser (except for a very simple one that does nothing but match pairs of braces -- also implemented in 'clexer.rl'). Being a simple tool, Mill does not attemp to do syntactic ananlysis of the source and relies fully on expanding  lexical tokens.</p>

<p>'clexer.rb' is thus the source code of the tokeniser. It is included into mill.dna which means that an exact copy of the code appears in 'mill'</p>

<p>'mill.dna' is the source code of the Mill preprocessor. It's in essence a Ruby code with some fancy syntax for code generation. It is processed by ribosome (use --rna switch to avoid runtime dependency on ribosome) to create 'mill'.</p>

<p>'mill' is the C preprocessor itself. It is a Ruby program, however, for convenience's sake it has no .rb extension.</p>

<p>'mill.h' and 'mill.c' implement the core language runtime. The code from 'mill.c' goes into 'stdmill.so'. 'mill.h' header must be installed in the runtime because it is included by the C code generated by 'mill' preprocessor.</p>

<p>'stdmill.mh' and 'stdmill.mc' implement the library of elementary coroutines (timers, socket operations et c.) They have to be pre-processed by 'mill' (use --system switch to provide them with more flexibility) to yield actual library source code.</p>

<p>'stdmill.h' and 'stdmill.c' are generated from 'stdmill.mh' and 'stdmill.mc'. Along with 'mill.h' and 'mill.c' they are the source code for Mill runtime library.</p>

<p>'libstdmill.so' is Mill runtime library. It has to be installed everywhere where Mill programs are being run. The library uses 'libuv.so' to interface with the operating system.</p>
